      “The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is the lawgiver.
      No playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful,
      has ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or field of battle
      and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.”
      ― Joseph Weizenbaum
